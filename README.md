| [OperationsPlanning](https://api.github.com/repos/SamruddhiGoswami/OperationsPlanning) | 3 | 1 | 0 | Vikings Division had experienced a loss of profit due to not meeting their demand on time (i.e., backorders) and maintaining high work-in-process (WIP) inventory resulting in long production times. This was due to many factors including inaccurate forecasting leading to incorrect production quantities of different types of products, running inappropriate lot sizes, and using no formal scheduling methodology. The objective of the project was to aid the Vikings Division in better planning their operations for the future. This can be achieved through establishing a formal method for forecasting the demand, planning the production based on BOM and capacity, and scheduling the production of the different product types. In essence, streamlining the overall operations at the Vikings Division in an effort to increase the chances of meeting the required product demand(s) on time. |
