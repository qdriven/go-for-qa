| [new-albums](https://github.com/riverscuomo/new-albums) | 131 | 21 | 1 | This project is for me to experiment with open-source collaboration. So please feel free to chime in and participate.  I've been learning programming since 2015 but I've been mostly working on my own. So my github/collaboration skills are weak. I'd like to learn more about collaboration so I can accomplish more as a programmer through teamwork.  One reason I've hesitated so long to try this is I'm worried about accidentally exposing API keys, secrets, credentials, and access to my users' data (not that I have much). So this project will be a first, low-risk, foray into the field of open-source collaboration. If things go well here, maybe I can start to open up some of my other repositiories. I could sure use some help. And I love that thought that some of my programs could be useful to others.  My first goal here is to understand how different developers can work on a codebase together without sharing credentials; to create a program that different people can use with their own credentials. I've attempted this by requiring collaborators (including myself) to use environment variables.  |

This was due to many factors including inaccurate forecasting leading to incorrect production quantities of different types of products, running inappropriate lot sizes, and using no formal scheduling methodology. The objective of the project was to aid the Vikings Division in better planning their operations for the future. This can be achieved through establishing a formal method for forecasting the demand, planning the production based on BOM and capacity, and scheduling the production of the different product types. In essence, streamlining the overall operations at the Vikings Division in an effort to increase the chances of meeting the required product demand(s) on time. |
