| [new-albums](https://github.com/riverscuomo/new-albums) | 131 | 21 | 1 | This project is for me to experiment with open-source collaboration. So please feel free to chime in and participate.  I've been learning programming since 2015 but I've been mostly working on my own. So my github/collaboration skills are weak. I'd like to learn more about collaboration so I can accomplish more as a programmer through teamwork.  One reason I've hesitated so long to try this is I'm worried about accidentally exposing API keys, secrets, credentials, and access to my users' data (not that I have much). So this project will be a first, low-risk, foray into the field of open-source collaboration. If things go well here, maybe I can start to open up some of my other repositiories. I could sure use some help. And I love that thought that some of my programs could be useful to others.  My first goal here is to understand how different developers can work on a codebase together without sharing credentials; to create a program that different people can use with their own credentials. I've attempted this by requiring collaborators (including myself) to use environment variables.  |
