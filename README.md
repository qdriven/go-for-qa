The objective of the project was to aid the Vikings Division in better planning their operations for the future. This can be achieved through establishing a formal method for forecasting the demand, planning the production based on BOM and capacity, and scheduling the production of the different product types. In essence, streamlining the overall operations at the Vikings Division in an effort to increase the chances of meeting the required product demand(s) on time. |
